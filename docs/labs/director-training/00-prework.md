```

## Pre-Training Checklist

Complete this checklist 24 hours before training:

- [ ] **Anthropic API key** created and saved securely
- [ ] **API credits** verified ($5+ available)
- [ ] **OpenShift access** confirmed (local or shared cluster)
- [ ] **Required software** installed and verified
- [ ] **Network connectivity** tested (can reach console.anthropic.com)
- [ ] **Laptop fully charged** with power adapter ready
- [ ] **Validation script** run successfully

## Training Day Requirements

### What to Bring

1. **Laptop** with all software installed
2. **Power adapter** (training is 3 hours)
3. **Anthropic API key** (saved in password manager or notes)
4. **Notebook** (optional - for notes)

### What We'll Provide

- Training materials and lab guides
- Sample code and templates
- Access to shared resources
- Support during hands-on exercises

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Can't Install OpenShift Local

**Solution**: Use the shared training cluster instead
- Instructor will provide access details on training day
- No local installation needed

### Issue: Anthropic API Key Not Working

**Symptoms**: Authentication errors when testing
**Solutions**:
1. Verify key was copied completely (no spaces)
2. Check account has available credits
3. Ensure key hasn't been deleted from console
4. Create a new key if needed

### Issue: oc/kubectl Commands Not Found

**macOS**:
```bash
brew install openshift-cli kubectl
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Linux**:
```bash
# Download oc CLI
curl -LO https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
sudo mv oc kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Issue: Not Enough Disk Space

**Required**: 20 GB free
**Check**:
```bash
df -h ~
```

**Solutions**:
- Clear Docker images: `docker system prune -a`
- Remove unused applications
- Move large files to external storage

### Issue: Corporate Proxy/Firewall

If you're behind a corporate proxy:

1. **Test API access**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://api.anthropic.com
   ```

2. **Configure proxy** (if needed):
   ```bash
   export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   ```

3. **Contact IT**: You may need proxy exceptions for:
   - `api.anthropic.com`
   - `console.anthropic.com`
   - OpenShift cluster URLs

## Getting Help

## Enterprise Security Considerations

Before deploying AI agents in your environment, understand these security
principles. We'll implement these in Lab 2.

(Source: IBM Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP)

### SOLUTION Framework

Enterprise AI security follows the SOLUTION framework:

**S**ecure by design
- AI agents follow least-privilege principles
- Encrypted secrets management (Kubernetes Secrets)
- Secure communication channels (TLS)

**O**bservability and monitoring
- Real-time session tracking
- Audit logs for all AI operations
- Usage and cost monitoring

**L**east privilege access
- RBAC for project and session access
- Namespace isolation per project
- Limited agent capabilities

**U**ser authentication and authorization
- OpenShift OAuth integration available
- Project-level access control
- API key rotation policies

**T**esting and validation
- Pre-deployment agent testing
- Prompt injection prevention
- Output validation

**I**ncident response
- Session termination capabilities
- Audit trail for investigations
- Error handling and recovery

**O**perational excellence
- High availability deployment
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Performance monitoring

**N**etwork segmentation
- Pod network policies
- Service mesh integration (optional)
- API gateway patterns

### Security Checklist for Training

Before training day, review:

- [ ] Understand API key storage (Kubernetes Secrets)
- [ ] Know your organization's data classification policies
- [ ] Review what data you'll use in training prompts
- [ ] Understand RBAC roles (View, Edit, Admin)
- [ ] Know who has access to your training project

**We'll implement these patterns in Lab 2: Enterprise Deployment**
