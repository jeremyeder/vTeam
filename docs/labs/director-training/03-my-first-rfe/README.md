# Lab 3: Your First AI-Generated Feature

## What We're Building Today ðŸŒ“

You know that dark mode option in your favorite apps? In this lab, you're going to watch AI build that feature for you. No coding. No copy/paste. Just describe what you want, and the system does the work.

By the end of this lab, you'll have:
- Created a feature request using natural language
- Watched AI generate working code automatically
- Reviewed the AI's implementation in a draft branch

---

## Part 1: Create Your Feature Request

### Step 1.1: Open the vTeam Web Interface

Your instructor will provide the URL. Navigate to `https://vteam.your-training-cluster.com`

You should see a clean dashboard with a "New RFE" button in the top right.

---

### Step 1.2: Start a New RFE

Click "New RFE" and describe what you want in the chat interface:

```
I want to add a dark mode toggle to the PatternFly React Seed app.

The button should:
- Appear in the top-right header
- Show a sun icon in dark mode, moon icon in light mode
- Smoothly transition between themes
- Remember the user's preference across sessions

The app should use PatternFly's built-in dark theme classes.
```

Hit Enter and watch what happens.

### Step 1.3: Watch the AI Council at Work

You'll see AI agents collaborating on your request:

- **Parker (PM)**: Analyzing business value and user benefits
- **Archie (Architect)**: Reviewing technical approach and dependencies
- **Stella (Staff Engineer)**: Planning implementation and estimating complexity

This takes about 2-3 minutes. Watch the conversation unfold in real-time - they debate, question each other, and refine the approach before any code is written.

---

### Step 1.4: Review the Refined RFE

Once the agents finish, you'll see their analysis and click "Approve RFE" to move to implementation.

---

## Part 2: AI Generates Your Code

### Step 2.1: Trigger Implementation

Click "Generate Code" in the Implementation Mode panel.

---

### Step 2.2: Review the Generated Code

Click the pull request URL from the logs to see the files changed and code quality.

---

### Step 2.3: Test the Implementation

Click "View Preview" to see the working dark mode toggle. Try it yourself - the theme smoothly transitions and persists across page refreshes.

## What Just Happened?

Traditional development takes 5-7 days with 15-20 person-hours. You just did it in 25 minutes.

- **Speed**: 30x faster end-to-end
- **Quality**: Production-ready code with tests
- **Cost**: ~$2 in AI costs vs. $400-600 in engineering time

Your engineers can now focus on truly complex problems while AI handles routine implementation work.

---

## Taking This Back to Your Teams

Ask your engineering leaders:
- How many features are waiting in refinement?
- What if we could refine and implement in the same day?
- What strategic work are we not doing because teams are heads-down on implementation?

**Next steps**: Identify 2-3 features that could be AI-generated and calculate the ROI for your context.

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on completing Lab 3!**

You've experienced the full AI-assisted development workflow. Ready for wrap-up discussion and Q&A.
