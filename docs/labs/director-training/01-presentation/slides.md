## Part 1: What is Ambient Code?

### The Challenge

**Traditional Development Workflow:**
- Engineers manually write requirements
- Back-and-forth clarification cycles
- Inconsistent requirement quality
- Time-consuming refinement process
- Knowledge silos across teams

**Result**: Weeks to refine features, delayed releases, quality gaps

---

### The Solution: Ambient Code

**AI-Powered Development Assistance**

> Ambient Code brings AI agents into your development workflow, automating requirement refinement and providing multi-perspective analysis.

**Key Capabilities:**
- ü§ñ Multi-agent collaboration
- üìù Automated requirement refinement
- üîç Multi-perspective quality analysis
- ‚ö° Rapid iteration cycles
- üéØ Consistent, high-quality output

### Architecture Overview

**Kubernetes-Native Platform**

(Source: vTeam README.md - Architecture section)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Web UI** | Create and manage agentic sessions |
| **Backend API** | Multi-tenant project management |
| **Operator** | Kubernetes automation & job scheduling |
| **AI Runners** | Claude Code CLI with agent collaboration |

**Result**: Enterprise-ready, scalable, secure

---

## Part 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration

### Why Multiple Agents?

**Single AI Limitation:**
- One perspective
- Generic feedback
- No specialized expertise

**Multi-Agent Advantage:**
- Diverse viewpoints
- Role-specific analysis
- Realistic team dynamics
- Comprehensive coverage

---

### Meet the Virtual Team

**The 7-Agent Council**

(Source: rhoai-ux-agents-vTeam.md - Complete agent framework)

1. **Parker (Product Manager)** - Business value & prioritization
2. **Archie (Architect)** - Technical feasibility & design
3. **Stella (Staff Engineer)** - Implementation complexity & quality
4. **Olivia (Product Owner)** - Acceptance criteria refinement
5. **Lee (Team Lead)** - Team coordination & execution
6. **Taylor (Team Member)** - Pragmatic implementation view
7. **Derek (Delivery Owner)** - Sprint planning & tickets

Each agent brings **domain expertise** and **seniority-appropriate perspective**

**Note**: Agents are built into the platform. View agent details at:

### How Agents Collaborate

**Sequential Workflow:**

    A[RFE Input] --> B[Parker: Business Assessment]
    B --> C[Archie: Technical Review]
    C --> D[Stella: Quality Check]
    D --> E[Olivia: Criteria Refinement]
    E --> F[Stella: Final Review]
    F --> G[Parker: Communication]
    G --> H[Derek: Implementation Plan]
```

**Checkpoints at Each Stage** - Quality gates throughout the process

---

### Agent Interaction Patterns

**Realistic Team Dynamics:**

- **Natural Tensions**: "Move fast" vs "Build it right"
- **Deference Patterns**: Junior agents defer to seniors
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Agents consult specialists
- **Productive Conflicts**: Surface important trade-offs

**Example:**
> Taylor: "This could ship in 2 weeks with basic validation"
> Stella: "We need comprehensive testing for data integrity"
> Archie: "Let's phase it - MVP in 2 weeks, full validation in sprint 2"

---

### Real Multi-Perspective Analysis

**Same Feature, Different Views:**

**Parker (PM)**: "High user value (8/10), aligns with Q4 growth goals"

**Archie (Architect)**: "Moderate complexity, requires API gateway changes"

**Stella (Staff Engineer)**: "3-week estimate, need dedicated QA resources"

**Result**: Comprehensive understanding before committing resources

---

## Part 3: Live Demo - RFE Builder

### Demo Scenario

**Feature Request**: "Add dark mode to our application"

**We'll watch:**
1. Natural language input
2. Multi-agent processing
3. Quality analysis from each agent
4. Final RFE with implementation plan

**Time**: ~5 minutes end-to-end

---

### Demo: Step 1 - Input

**Web UI:**
- Create new agentic session
- Enter natural language description
- Configure AI model and settings
- Start workflow

**Input:**
> "I want to add a dark mode toggle to our web application. Users should be able to switch between light and dark themes, and their preference should be saved across sessions."

---

### Demo: Step 2 - Agent Processing

**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Watch agents activate sequentially
- See specialized analysis from each role
- Observe reasoning and decision-making
- View quality checkpoints

**Expected Duration**: 2-3 minutes for complete analysis
