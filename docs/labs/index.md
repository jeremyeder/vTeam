# Hands-On Labs

Welcome to the vTeam hands-on learning labs! These practical exercises will guide you through mastering AI-powered automation using AgenticSessions in a Kubernetes-native environment.

## Lab 1: Your First Agentic Session

This foundational lab introduces you to vTeam's core workflow by creating and monitoring an AgenticSession. You'll learn how to configure sessions, monitor execution, and interpret results.

**[Start Lab 1 ‚Üí](basic/lab-1-first-rfe.md)**

**Time**: 30-45 minutes
**Level**: Beginner
**Prerequisites**: Completed [Getting Started Guide](../user-guide/getting-started.md)

### What You'll Learn

- Create AgenticSessions using the web interface
- Understand interactive vs headless execution modes
- Configure single-repo and multi-repo sessions
- Monitor real-time session execution and status
- Review session results and Kubernetes resource lifecycle
- Troubleshoot common issues

### Lab Scenario

You'll automate code analysis and documentation generation tasks by creating AgenticSessions that:
- Analyze a Python repository and generate README documentation
- Perform interactive refactoring conversations
- Compare patterns across multiple repositories

## Lab Format

### **Step-by-Step Instructions** üìù
Detailed procedures with code examples and validation checkpoints

### **Troubleshooting** üõ†Ô∏è
Common issues and solutions

### **Key Learnings** üìö
Summary of concepts mastered

## Prerequisites

Before starting Lab 1, ensure you have:

- [ ] **vTeam installed and running** - Complete [Getting Started Guide](../user-guide/getting-started.md)
- [ ] **Anthropic API key** configured in ProjectSettings
- [ ] **At least one project** created in vTeam
- [ ] **Web browser** for accessing the vTeam interface
- [ ] **Basic Git familiarity** (optional, for multi-repo exercises)

## Lab Environment Setup

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone vTeam repository
git clone https://github.com/ambient-code/vTeam.git
cd vTeam

# Start local development environment (OpenShift Local/CRC)
make dev-start

# Access the frontend
echo "https://$(oc get route vteam-frontend -n vteam-dev -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
```

See the [Getting Started Guide](../user-guide/getting-started.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Skills You'll Develop

### **Technical Skills**
- Kubernetes Custom Resource management (AgenticSessions, ProjectSettings)
- REST API usage for session lifecycle management
- Kubernetes CLI operations (kubectl/oc)
- Multi-repository workflows

### **AI Automation Skills**
- Writing effective prompts for code analysis and generation
- Understanding AI agent execution models
- Monitoring long-running AI tasks
- Interpreting AI-generated results

### **DevOps Skills**
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Job-based execution patterns
- Secret management for API keys
- Resource monitoring and troubleshooting

## Success Criteria

After completing Lab 1, you should be able to:

- [ ] Create AgenticSessions via web UI and understand the underlying Kubernetes resources
- [ ] Choose appropriate session modes (interactive vs headless) for different tasks
- [ ] Configure single-repo and multi-repo sessions
- [ ] Monitor session execution using both UI and CLI
- [ ] Troubleshoot common session failures
- [ ] Interpret session results and status information
- [ ] Explain vTeam's Kubernetes-native architecture

## Next Steps After Lab 1

Once you've completed Lab 1, explore advanced AgenticSession capabilities:

- **Multi-repo patterns**: Experiment with cross-repository analysis and migration workflows
- **Interactive sessions**: Build iterative development workflows using inbox/outbox communication
- **Custom ProjectSettings**: Configure default models, timeouts, and team-specific settings
- **API integration**: Automate session creation via REST API for CI/CD pipelines
- **CLAUDE.md exploration**: Deep-dive into the complete AgenticSession specification and backend architecture
