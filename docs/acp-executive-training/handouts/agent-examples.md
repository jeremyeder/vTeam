## How to Customize These Templates

1. **Adjust for your domain**: Replace generic terms with your specific tech stack
2. **Add your constraints**: Include your specific compliance, security, or performance requirements
3. **Tune the output**: Modify format to match your team's preferences
4. **Set thresholds**: Add specific numbers for your SLAs, limits, and requirements
5. **Include examples**: Add real examples from your system to guide the analysis

## Deployment Tips

1. **Start with one**: Pick the template that addresses your biggest pain point
2. **Test on real RFEs**: Use actual backlog items, not hypothetical examples
3. **Iterate quickly**: Version 1 just needs to be better than manual
4. **Measure impact**: Track time saved and issues caught
5. **Share successes**: When it catches something important, tell everyone

## Creating Your Own

Use this pattern:

```yaml
name: "[Role] [Domain] Expert"
persona: "[UNIQUE_ID]"
role: "[Specific problem solved]"

prompt: |
  You are an expert at [specific domain].
  
  For every RFE, check:
  1. [Most important thing]
  2. [Second most important]
  3. [Third most important]
  
  Output:
  ## Assessment: [Scale or level]
  ## Key Findings: [Bullets]
  ## Actions: [Checklist]
```
