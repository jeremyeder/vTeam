## Overview

The **vTeam** repository contains a dual-purpose AI automation platform:

1. **Refinement Agent Team System** - A production-ready multi-agent AI automation platform built on LlamaDeploy and @llamaindex/server that dramatically reduces the time engineering teams spend in refinement meetings through a 7-step agent council workflow
2. **vTeam Shared Configs** - A Python package for managing shared Claude Code configuration across development teams

The Refinement Agent Team system transforms Request for Enhancement (RFE) submissions into well-refined, implementation-ready tickets through intelligent AI agent collaboration, enabling engineering teams to start work immediately with comprehensive context and clear acceptance criteria.

## Quick Start

Get started in 5 minutes:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/vTeam.git
   cd vTeam
   ```

2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cd demos/rfe-builder
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Configure API access**
   Set up your API keys in `src/.env`:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Start the system**
   ```bash
   # Start LlamaDeploy API server
   uv run -m llama_deploy.apiserver
   
   # In another terminal, deploy the workflow
   uv run llamactl deploy deployment.yml
   ```

## Agent Council Workflow

The system implements a 7-step refinement process with specialized AI agents:

1. **Parker (PM)** - RFE Prioritization and business value assessment
2. **Archie (Architect)** - Technical feasibility and design review
3. **Stella (Staff Engineer)** - Implementation completeness validation
4. **Archie (Architect)** - Acceptance criteria refinement
5. **Stella (Staff Engineer)** - Final accept/reject decision
6. **Parker (PM)** - Stakeholder communication and updates
7. **Derek (Delivery Owner)** - Feature ticket creation and planning

Each agent brings specialized expertise and realistic team dynamics to ensure comprehensive RFE refinement.
